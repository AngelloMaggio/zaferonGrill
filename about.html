                <h4 class="section-title">Soody Nelson, Owner</h4>

                <p>
                    “Growing up, I had a large family,” says Soody Nelson, the owner of Zaferon Grill.  “We regularly had friends and relatives dine with us. Our table was always set for 10 or more people, and my mother cooked for twice that in anticipation of unexpected guests, who were always welcomed.  She would offer a feast creatively and spontaneously.  Every meal was prepared by my mother with fresh ingredients - farm-to-table style. Food was a sensory symphony meant to be enjoyed in its natural, pure state.”
                    <br/>
                    These are the same principles guiding the culinary concept at Zaferon Grill.
                    <br/>
                    The name of the restaurant, Zaferon, is also a subtle nod to her roots—it’s the Persian pronunciation of the spice, saffron. Saffron is the trademark spice of Persian cuisine that’s gaining traction around the world—learn all about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron"> here</a>.
                    <br/>
                    Just like the dining table from her childhood, Zaferon will be a gathering place where guests can celebrate. "Food is at the center of every gathering and helps people share their care and love for one another.
