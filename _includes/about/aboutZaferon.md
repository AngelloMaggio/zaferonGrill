Zaferon Grill is a new concept restaurant offering a unique experience inspired by Mediterranean and Persian traditions and flavors. The ambiance is contemporary, casual and inviting. The open-kitchen design allows guests to watch their food being prepared.

Our culinary creations are fresh and nutritious featuring organic, hormone and antibiotic-free meat and poultry, wild caught fish and organic produce finely blended with herbs and spices. All of this is complemented by flat bread baked in-house daily.

There will be something for everyone to enjoy at Zaferon Grill. Guests can enjoy freshly blended juices from the juice bar or one of the many items on the menu which also include gluten free, vegan and vegetarian options.

We use locally sourced products so long as available, and are committed to sustainable practices.
